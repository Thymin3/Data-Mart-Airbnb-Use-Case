# Data-Mart-Airbnb-Use-Case

## Introduction

The aim of this project was to create a data mart with appropriate exemplary data for the Airbnb Use 
Case. After designing an Entity Relationship Model (ERM) a relational SQL database schema was 
implemented in MySQL and subsequently filled with sample data.
Additional to the necessary SQL files, please find additional documentation about the concept (P1) and development (P2) phases in the pdf files respectively.

## Installation of the database

To set up the Airbnb Database and execute the test cases, follow these steps:
### 1. Database schema
Run the `Esser-Martina_32212057_DLBDSPBDM01_P3_S_Airbnb_schema.sql` file in your 
preferred MySQL environment to create the database schema.
### 2. Sample data
Execute the `Esser-Martina_32212057_DLBDSPBDM01_P3_S_Airbnb_inputs.sql` file to populate 
the tables with sample data.
### 3. Test cases
Run the `Esser-Martina_32212057_DLBDSPBDM01_P3_S_Airbnb_testcases.sql` file to execute 
various test cases against the database. Verify the results and check for any anomalies. The tables 
should look like the ones in the PowerPoint presentation, except for the tables which were populated 
with randomly generated data.

### Requirements:
- MySQL Database Management System (DBMS)
- MySQL Workbench (optional, but recommended for easy database management)
